Welcome to the documentation for the `backup` package. This documentation is
intended for the following users:

If you're interested in:
1. the APIs offered by the modules/classes provided in the `backup` package for
   use in your own scripts
2. the internals of the modules/classes provided in the `backup` package for
   reference when improving those modules/classes

Then this documentation is for you. If you're less interested in those things
and would prefer a script that works out of the box, check out the
`create_backup.py` script provided in the git repository, which is very lightly
documented here. For a quick reference on getting started with that script see
the README.

In addition to a ready to go solution, `create_backup.py` is a very basic
example of how the classes are designed to be used and could be a good starting
point for those who want to use those classes.
